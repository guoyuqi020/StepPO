# StepPO: Step-Aligned Policy Optimization for Agentic Reinforcement Learning

> 🧠 StepPO advocates a **step-level** perspective on Agentic RL: the conventional token-level MDP should be advanced to a **step-level MDP**, and the *step*, rather than the *token*, should be regarded as the proper action representation for LLM agents.
> 
> ⚙️ We propose **step-level credit assignment** as the natural optimization counterpart, aligning policy optimization and reward propagation with the granularity of agent decisions.

## 🚀 From Token-Level to Step-Level Agentic RL

Agentic RL is emerging as a central post-training paradigm for empowering LLMs with agentic capabilities such as decision making, tool use, and environment interaction. However, the token-centric modeling and optimization paradigm inherited from RLHF/RLVR is becoming increasingly inadequate for multi-turn interactive settings.

> **Token-Level MDP (PPO, Reinforce++):**
> Each token is treated as an atomic action. Credit assignment operates at token granularity — too local and noisy for long-horizon agent decisions.
>
> **Trajectory-Level Credit (GRPO, RLOO):**
> The entire trajectory receives a single reward signal. Credit assignment is too coarse to identify the contribution of intermediate decisions.
>
> **Step-Level MDP + Step-Level Credit (StepPO):**
> Each complete interaction round forms the proper transition unit. Credit assignment aligns with the step — the natural granularity of agent behavior.

## 🧠 Step-Level MDP Formulation

![MDP](assets/mdp.png)

In StepPO, we redefine the MDP for LLM agents at the granularity of interaction steps rather than individual tokens:

### Core Components

![rep](assets/rep.png)

* **State.**
  The prompt and environment observation at the start of an interaction turn.

* **Action.**
  The *entire model response* generated in one turn (thought + tool call), rather than a single token.

* **Transition.**
  The environment's response (tool output, observation update) to the agent's complete action.

* **Reward.**
  Delayed and sparse reward signals that must be properly propagated back to intermediate steps via step-level credit assignment.

This formulation captures the natural decision-making granularity of LLM agents — each step involves reading observations, reasoning, and producing a complete action, followed by an environment transition that yields new information.

## ⚙️ Step-Level Credit Assignment

Training multi-turn agents with standard RL methods faces a fundamental **granularity mismatch**:

* **Token-level PPO**
  ❌ Too local — individual tokens are not meaningful decision units for tool use and environment interaction
* **Trajectory-level GRPO**
  ❌ Too coarse — cannot distinguish which intermediate steps contributed to the outcome

### ✨ Our Solution: Step-Level GAE

StepPO implements **step-level Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)**, which aligns credit assignment exactly with the agent's interaction granularity:

![credit](assets/credit.png)

**Key properties of step-level credit assignment:**

* Treats each *complete agent response* (thought + action) as an atomic action unit
* Performs **step-level advantage estimation** — rewards are summed within each step, then GAE propagates credit across steps
* The critic estimates **state values at step boundaries** (before the first response token of each step)
* Advantages are whitened at step level, then broadcast to token level for policy gradient
* Significantly improves **training stability and credit accuracy** over token-level alternatives

## 🏗️ Systems Design

Step-level Agentic RL places unique demands on training infrastructure. StepPO is built on top of **veRL** and addresses these challenges through:

![train](assets/train.png)

* **Token-space consistency**: Rollout and training operate on the same tokenized data, avoiding retokenization drift that can break step-aligned learning
* **Trajectory-native data management**: Each trajectory is composed of multiple steps, tracked via `trajectory_uids` and `step_indices` for proper credit assignment
* **Asynchronous agent rollout**: Agent-environment interaction is managed via `AgentFlowManager`, supporting heterogeneous environments with variable step counts
* **Flexible advantage estimation**: Three modes supported — `gae` (step-level), `token_gae` (token-level), and `grpo` (trajectory-level) — configurable via Hydra
